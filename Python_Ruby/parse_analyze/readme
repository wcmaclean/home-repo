I handled the missing data by initializing everything 
with values from the original portfolio. I realized 
later what I should have done was, at the beginning of 
the calculation, initialize only the first attempt with 
that data. Then, copy the changed values for the next 
calculation into the same set - to carry over previous 
changes.

I didn't think of handling it this way until my brain 
was burnt.

I suspect that my solutions look alot like a Java 
programmer trying figure out Python and Ruby. 

This is algorithm is far from effecient...
But it mostly works at least.

These are all the versions I started that don't work 
much at all...

The reason my brain was burnt.
