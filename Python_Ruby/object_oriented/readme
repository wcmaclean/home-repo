stocksob.py
-----------
Run as:
prompt> python stocksobj.py

This version uses portreader.py to read a *.rec file to create
a dictionary of instances of the Stock class, accessing instance
variables directly, without any accessors and mutators.

Modified to use tableformatter classes at the end.

------------
stocksacc.py
------------
Run as:
prompt> python stocksacc.py

This version uses portreader.py to read a *.csv file to create 
a dictionary of Stock objects, accessing instance variables with
mutators and accessors.

Modified to use tableformatter classes at the end.

------------
stocksobj.rb
------------
Run as:
prompt> ruby stocksobj.rb

Because accessing instance variables directly in Ruby is 
impossible, this version has accessors and mutators - but
done long-hand. It uses portreader.rb to read a *.csv file
to create Stock objects.

Modified to use tableformatter classes at the end.

------------
stocksacc.rb
------------
Run as:
prompt> ruby stocksacc.rb

This version uses the shorthand to declare accessors and 
mutators for the Stocks objects. It uses portreader.rb 
to read an *.rec files into Stock objects.

Modified to use tableformatter classes at the end.

-------------------------------
portreader.py and portreader.rb
-------------------------------
These files can read *.csv or *.rec files, and parse them into 
lists of lists - with all data in columns. It knows nothing
of the Stocks data, returning only rows and columns, which
are generic enough to be used anywhere.

---------------------------------------
tableformatter.py and tableformatter.rb
---------------------------------------
These have several classes, inheriting methods from the base class, 
to format tables into several format (.txt, .html, .csv). Each one
also prints out a copy of the formatted table to a file.

----------
testmod.py
----------
This is a python module I wrote to test if a value is in int or
a float. I didn't end up needing it, so I didn't use it.
