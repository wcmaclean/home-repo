Lab 3, Ex 3 - filecopy

1. Run the makefile:
	prompt> make
	
2. Run the program:
	prompt> filecopy <source filename> <destination filename>
	
3. To clean up after:
	prompt> make clean 
	
What it  does:

It takes two arguments from the command line, the source and
target file names, and assign a char pointer to each. It 
checks to make sure the contents of the filenames are different -
if they are the same, it reports an error. It also checks that there
are two filenames before it proceeds. Then, it opens the 
source file in read-only mode and opens (creating if it does not
exist) the target file. It reads a char at a time from the source 
and writes each char as it goes, doing this as long as there 
are chars to read from the source.
