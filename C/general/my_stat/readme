what it does
------------
It takes a string from the command line, creates an 
empty stat structure, and uses lstat to read the 
filename named in the string into the empty stat 
structure. 

It then uses the stat methods, printf, and some
other things to show everything:

-the filename is printed straight from the args array
-st_size reads the filesize 
-st_blocksize and st_block give you the block info
-a mode_t is read analyzed in else-if to print file type
-the mode is also used to print access permissions in octal
-the mode is analyzed in else-ifs to print the file type again,
	but this time for the permissions string
-the mode is analyzed in more else-ifs to build the
	owner, group, other permissions string
-a passwd is created and used to see if the owner
	has a real name to print - and prints it is so
-a group is created and used to print the group name
-a tm is used to translate the st_atime, st_ctime, and st_mtime 
	into human-readable form to print
